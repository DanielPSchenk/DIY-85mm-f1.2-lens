# DIY-85mm-f1.2-lens
a lens housing made to work with two +6 eyeglass lenses measuring 70mm each. Everything is optimized for fdm printing with an .4mm nozzle .2mm layer thickness. Feel free to build your own
shopping list:
- black printing filament. Any common filament type should work
- lens mount. Prepared for Canon EF mount. If you want a different mount, you might have to redesign the rear part and the lens bayonet holder.
- 2x 70mm diameter +6 optical glasses.
- 15x M3 10mm screws and DIN 4032 nuts
The plastic optics I used contracted a lot when frozen so I simply shrink them to install them without without needing glue or force.
